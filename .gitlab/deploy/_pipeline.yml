# Typically, a Capstan pipeline would include a promote stage (see
# https://wiki.ithaka.org/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=softdel&title=The+container+image+promotion+process).
# However, since we are pulling an image from a remote repo, promotion:
# * does not work (the image is not located where the promotion job would look)
# * is not necessary (the deploy script will look at the remote repo before
#   looking through our snapshot/rc/stable repos).
